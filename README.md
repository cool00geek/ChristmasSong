# Christmas Song

An Android app created to provide a sound from a little toy train.

Upon taking the directory for the christmas carols and the train sound, it'll play the christmas carols, and every 60-90 seconds, reduce the volume of the carols, play the train sound, and bring the volume back up.

A very specific app to improve our Christmas decorations for the year :)
